# ArraySorter

A program wrtten using C99 Standard that originally serves as my 1st semester Final Project.
The whole program is not using neither dynamic array or linked-list, so stuff like insertion is done with array in mind.

I named it ArraySorter as the original intention was to make an array sorting program, and it ended up as this.
## Functionalities
1. Sorting
    
    Sorting using either Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Selection Sort Algorithm.

2. Searching the Element

    Searching the element in the array for given value, and return the index of it.

3. Inserting New Element

    Insertion done directly to the array itself.

4. Updating Element

    Updating a element that currently exists in the array.

5. Removing Element

    Removing existing element from the array.

6. Get Array Length

    Get the length of array currently used.

7. Smallest Element
    Get the smallest value an element hold. 

8. Largest Element

    Get the largest value an elemnt hold.

9. Average

    Get the average value of all element currently existed in the array.

10. Oddness

    Get list of odd element currently in the array.

11. Evenness

    Get list of even element currently in the array.

## Other Information

+ A Logfile will be created with the date and time of which the program is initialized as its filename.
+ A Whole program is written in C99 Standard
+ Array used is a plain Array so adding new elmeent, removing an element, etc are made for plain array in mind
+ No Linked-List or dynamic array are used in this program.
